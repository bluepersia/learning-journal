            My new journey as a bootcamp student.

          <p class="full-post__description">
            After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
            Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code
            reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

              <p class="full-post__content-description">
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend
                hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects
                using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
                projects.
              </p>
              <p class="full-post__content-description">
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share
                what I was learning and most things about my journey with the
                world.

              <p class="full-post__content-description">
                Since creating my first landing page, I've been able to share my
                projects publicly and easily receive feedback from friends,
                family and classmates.
              </p>
              <p class="full-post__content-description">
                I've been able to get a better understanding of how I learn
                best. I've also met some great people who have helped me learn
                and stay motivated.
